# Programming Paradigms Repository

This repository showcases my work for the graduate-level Advanced **Programming Language Principles** class. 
It features examples of various programming constructs implemented in different programming languages. 
The repository includes implementations in Haskell, JavaScript, Ruby, LaTeX, Operational Semantics, and more.

By exploring this repository, you can gain insights into different programming paradigms and their practical applications. 
Each folder within the repository represents a specific programming language or concept, with code examples and explanations provided.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation to deepen your understanding of programming languages and their underlying principles. 
If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
